The data for this project is not included, their files are too large to upload. It can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection/data . 

How to Run:
1. Run the "Main" section first to train the model and get model losses for the next step
2. Then run "GoogLeNet Results" section to see a plot of train/test loss vs number of epochs and some test images
3. "Kaggle Section" will generate a csv with the specified feature locations predicted that is fit for Kaggle submission
